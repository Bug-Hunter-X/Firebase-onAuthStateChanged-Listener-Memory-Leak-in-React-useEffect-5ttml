The corrected code ensures the listener is always detached using a more robust approach.  Here's an example of how to improve the code. We are using the return value of onAuthStateChanged, which is an unsubscribe function. This function must be called to properly detach the listener.

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth';
import { auth } from './firebase'; // Your Firebase configuration

function MyComponent() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
      setUser(user);
    });
    return () => {
      // Ensure unsubscribe is always called when the component is unmounted
      unsubscribe();
    };
  }, []);

  // ... rest of your component
}
```

This improved version guarantees the `unsubscribe` function is always called when the component unmounts, preventing potential memory leaks.
